# ResNet-in-PyTorch

I've created a little PyTorch tutorial on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNets).
It has been my first attempt to create a tutorial. I hope people will enjoy it and find it helpful. Just open the Jupyter Notebook `ResNet in PyTorch.ipynb` and dive into it!
